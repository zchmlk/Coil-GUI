Toroidal Magnetic Coil Simulation GUI

GUI code and supporting coil object files. Run GUI.py to check out the GUI I made for the HIT-SI lab at UW that plots (I personally like the filled contours) toroidally the magnetic flux of magnetic coils on a variable mesh. Instructions for use are given in the console. (You may need to download XQuartz if using a Mac)
